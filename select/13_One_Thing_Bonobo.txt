Oh, I'm tryna let it go
Tryna keep my eyes closed
Tryna keep it like it was before
The times we never even thought to speak
I don't wanna tell you what it is
But it felt so serious
It's got me thinking just too much
I wanna set it off, but

It's this one thing that's got me trippin'
It's this one thing that's got me trippin'
You did this one thing and I was so with it
It's this one thing you did (wa-oh-wa-aa)
It's this one thing that caught me slippin'
It's this one thing, don't want to admit it
You did this one thing and I was so with it
It's this one thing you did (wa-oh-wa-aa)

And we don't know each other well
Why do I keep picking up my cell?
Memories just keep ringing bells
Hear voices I don't wanna understand
My car keys are jingling in my hands
My high heels are clicking towards your door

It's this one thing that's got me trippin'
It's this one thing that's got me trippin'
You did this one thing and I was so with it
It's this one thing you did (wa-oh-wa-aa)
It's this one thing that's caught me slippin'
It's this one thing, don't want to admit it
You did this one thing and I was so with it
It's this one thing you did (wa-oh-wa-aa)

(Aa-aa-aa-a)
(Aa-aa-aa-a)
It's this one thing that's got me trippin'
It's this one thing that's got me trippin'
You did this one thing and I was so with it
It's this one thing you did (wa-oh-wa-aa)
It's this one thing that's caught me slippin'
It's this one thing, don't want to admit it
You did this one thing and I was so with it
It's this one thing you did (wa-oh-wa-aa)

Oh, you don't mean nothin' at all to me (Hey, hey)
No, you don't mean nothin' at all to me (Hey, hey)
Oh, you don't mean nothin' at all to me (Hey, hey)
No, you don't mean nothin' at all to me (Hey, hey)
