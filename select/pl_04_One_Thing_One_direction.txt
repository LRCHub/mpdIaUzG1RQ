I've tried playing it cool
But when I'm looking at you
I can't ever be brave
Cos you make my heart race
Shot me out of the sky
You're my kryptonite
You keep making me weak
Yeah frozen and can't breathe
Something's gotta give now
Cos I'm dying just to
make you see
That I need you here with me now
Cos you've got that one thing
So get out get out get
out of my head
And fall into my arms instead
I don't, I don't,
don't know what it is
But I need that one thing
And you've got that one thing
Now I'm climbing the walls
But you won't notice at all
That I'm going out of my mind
All day
And all night
Something's gotta give now
Cos I'm dying just to
know your name
And I need you here with me now
Cos you've got that one thing
So get out get out get
out of my head
And fall into my arms instead
I don't, I don't,
don't know what it is
But I need that one thing
So get out get out get
out of my mind
And come on come into my life
I don't, I don't,
don't know what it is
But I need that one thing
And you've got that one thing
Oh Oh Oh
You've got that one thing
Get out get out get
out of my head
And fall into my arms instead
So get out get out get
out of my head
And fall into my arms instead
I don't, I don't,
don't know what it is
But I need that one thing
So get out get out get
out of my mind
(out of my mind)
And come on come into my life
I don't, I don't,
don't know what it is
But I need that one thing
And you’ve got that one thing
