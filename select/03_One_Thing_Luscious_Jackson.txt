Something wrong's goin' on today
People with nothing getting thrown away
Too much blood spilled by diseased minds
Filled with fear, yeah they're all filled with fear

So many broken faces
Everywhere I look
Killing of spirits people hold the power
Lights in their eyes have been
Turned off for so long

Everybody, everybody's tryin' to make a dollar
Made Marvin scream, made him wanna holler
This ain't livin' it's just surviving
Don't you know, this ain't livin'
It's just surviving

One thing I know for sure is
That something just ain't right
One thing I know for sure is
That something just ain't right

That man with no home
Was once a baby, a little baby
That lady with no home
Can't remember how she got there

One thing I know for sure is
That something just ain't right
One thing I know for sure is
That something just ain't right

One thing I know for sure is
That something just ain't right
One thing I know for sure is
That something just ain't right

So afraid of what you can't understand
Try harder to comprehend
Feelings of guilt keep pouring down
Deny deny it will eat you up inside
